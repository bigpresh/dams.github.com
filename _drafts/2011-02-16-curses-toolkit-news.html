<p>I&#39;ve recently started&#0160;</p>

<p>I&#39;ll probably move away from Typepad. It&#39;s slower than before, and it&#39;s less and less practical, compared to other solutions. I plan to move towards more&#0160;&quot;agile&quot; solutions&#0160;like <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_self">jekyll</a>&#0160;or <a href="http://www.blogofile.com/" target="_self">blogofile</a>, hosted on <a href="http://github.com/" target="_self">github</a>. Github even has <a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_self">instructions</a>&#0160;on how to setup jekyll. Do you have other blog aware static HTML pages generators I should consider ? I used to use <a href="http://nanoblogger.sf.net/" target="_self">nanoblogger</a>&#0160;long time ago, but it&#39;s a bit limited.</p>
